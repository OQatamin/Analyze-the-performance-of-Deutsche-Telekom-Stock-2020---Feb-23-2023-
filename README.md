# Analyze-the-performance-of-Deutsche-Telekom-Stock-2020---Feb-23-2023-


In this project, I embarked on an in-depth analysis of Deutsche Telekom's stock data (DTE.DE) to demonstrate a comprehensive set of data analysis skills, suitable for showcasing on GitHub as a testament to my proficiency in handling financial datasets. Utilizing Python and its rich ecosystem of data science libraries—including pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical computations, matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization, and Prophet for time series forecasting—I aimed to provide a multi-faceted view of stock market dynamics.

The core of this analysis involved processing the stock data to calculate daily returns, identify significant volume changes, and classify market behavior into bull and bear phases. These steps laid the groundwork for a nuanced exploration of market trends and investor behavior. Advanced visualization techniques were employed to depict the stock's price movements and trading volumes over time, enhancing the interpretability of market activity and the stock’s response to varying market conditions.

Further statistical analysis and the application of technical indicators, such as moving averages and Bollinger Bands, allowed for the identification of potential trading signals. These indicators served as tools to decipher the stock's volatility and trending strength, providing insights into strategic trading opportunities.

A significant portion of the project was dedicated to predictive modeling using the Prophet library. By tailoring models with added seasonalities and adjusting for changepoints, I aimed to refine the accuracy of stock price forecasts. The performance of these models was critically evaluated through metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), offering a quantitative comparison of their predictive capabilities.

This comprehensive analysis not only sheds light on the intricacies of Deutsche Telekom's stock behavior but also serves as a showcase of my analytical capabilities. Through detailed data manipulation, insightful visualizations, sophisticated statistical analysis, and predictive modeling, this project is positioned as a robust example of applying data science techniques to financial markets. It is intended for publication on GitHub, reflecting my ability to leverage advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques to extract meaningful insights from complex financial datasets.
